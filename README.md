This python-based project investigates how movements in oil and gas prices affect agricultural commodities, combining econometric techniques with systematic trading logic.
The goal is to identify and test tradeable relationships across commodity markets.

This work includes exploratory data analysis, econometric modelling, signal generation based on price patterns and backtesting to evaluate strategy performance 
using futures price data. The data sources are Yahoo Finance, World Bank and Quandl. This work is in progress
